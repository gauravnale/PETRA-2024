						<p class="text-justify">
							Pervasive technologies have shown to be instrumental in improving healthcare. 
							This year Petra 2020 introduces a panel on the computational challenges 
							related to the assessment, monitoring and prediction of health and wellbeing. 
							A team of experts will discuss various topics ranging from challenges in 
							predicting and preventing depression, to challenges in implementing 
							evidence-based practices for deployed veterans, to fatigue assessment using 
							neuroimaging as a result of injury or disease.  All three are examples of 
							how computational methods in artificial intelligence, pervasive computing 
							and data analytics can support accurate decision making and improve the cost 
							of care while reducing or slowing the effect of the disease.  The audience 
							is invited to share opinions and ask questions.

							investments in research, as a society and community of scientists we are still 
							at a loss for how to predict and prevent the onset of depression. Especially 
							troublesome are the accelerating rates of depression and suicide among youth. 
							Any hope for breaking the code to preventing youth suicide attempts and 
							completions lies in having a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms 
							that play a causal role. This presentation describes our current multidisciplinary 
							research efforts to identify biological, neuropsychological, psychological, 
							social, activity, and family risk factors for major depression in young people 
							ages 10 to 24.  The Texas – Resilience Against Depression (T-RAD) Project aims 
							to identify risk profiles for the onset of depression as well as predictors of 
							treatment response.  </p></td>

								<p class="text-justify"><strong>Abstract:</strong></br> Deployed Veterans, i.e., former military 
								personnel stationed overseas in theaters of war, represent a distinct population of 
								veterans. Approximately 30% of the 20 million living U.S. Veterans have been deployed. 
								Deployment-related experiences increase the risk for negative health impacts such as 
								sleep disturbances, chronic musculoskeletal pain, relationship difficulties, sexual 
								dysfunction, alcohol misuse, and obesity. There are also unique health concerns by 
								cohort, such as burn pit smoke exposures of Iraq and Afghanistan since 2001. 
								Unfortunately, there are gaps in the delivery of care for sleep disturbances, chronic 
								musculoskeletal pain, and burn pit smoke health effects. The presentation will describe 
								and illustrate actual and proposed examples of the implementation of evidence-based 
								practices (EBPs) to improve the health and wellness of deployed Veterans with these 
								concerns in the Veterans Health Administration. At the end of the presentation, 
								learners will be able to:
								<ol>
									<li>Articulate the RE-AIM model of implementation of EBPs. </li>
									<li>Describe the applicable components of the consolidated framework for implementation research (CFIR).</li>
									<li>Explain three examples of the data needs, sources, analyses, and uses in the implementation of EBPs for the concerns of deployed Veterans.</li>

							after brain injury or disease is fatigue.  While this has been known for over 100 years, 
							fatigue has proven very difficult to study, in part because until recently the only way to 
							assess fatigue has been via self-report.  With the advent of neuroimaging, we have new tools 
							to study psychological constructs such as fatigue -- tools that provide new dependent measures 
							for old scientific questions.  In this talk, I will explain how we have applied neuroimaging 
							to the study of fatigue, and how this has allowed us to not only begin to define the neural 
							network underlying fatigue but has also allowed us to better understand what fatigue is.</p></td>
