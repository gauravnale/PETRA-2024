				<h4><span class="text-info">Smart-Access</span>: The 2nd International Workshop on Accessibility and the Smart City: Technological Challenges and Open Accessibility Issues</h4>
				<p class="text-justify"> A Smart city is an urban area that uses different types 
				of electronic Internet of Things sensors to collect data and then use insights 
				gained from that data to manage assets, resources and services efficiently. This
				workshop will address issues relating to developments in the area of assistive 
				technology and smart environments which enable all groups of citizens to take 
				advantage of the services provided within the smart city concept. Ambient Assisted
				Living (AAL) forms a framework of human-machine interaction which incorporates 
				technologies that support accessibility to services and electronic content as 
				well as to various smart devices, by user communities with different communicative
			    skills. The addressed domain entails more efficient assistive system performance,
				interaction and communication aspects towards inclusive human-machine 
				collaboration, as well as incorporation of accessibility features in Ambient 
				Intelligence systems. </p>
				
				<p class="text-justify">A primary goal of assistive technology is to become more 
				efficient and more user friendly, especially by increasing user confidence and 
				motivation. These tasks require enhancement of the various technologies embedded 
				in products and services, as well as advanced communication strategies. In this 
				landscape, the systems’ motivation and human-like interaction characteristics, in 
				principle, target intuitive human-machine communication and cooperation by 
				exploiting a full spectrum of human communication and sensory-motor channels 
				and strategies. The major challenge is to develop enabling rather than excluding 
				smart technologies for all users. Paradigms of implementation of such technologies 
				are various apps exploiting speech synthesis and speech recognition potentials, 
				but also technologies that enable communication via sign languages and multimodal 
				interaction options embedded in human-centered HCI environments.</p>

				<p class="text-justify">This workshop aims to provide a meeting point for the 
				multidisciplinary community of researchers addressing the different aspects that 
				contribute towards placing assistive systems and devices in the landscape of the 
				rapidly developing smart environments, focusing on the major accessibility issues 
				and challenges that arise from extensive application of emerging technologies. 
				Thus, a constructive dialogue is expected among groups involved in all relevant 
				domains. </br>
