				<h4><span class="text-info">PAME</span>: 1st International Workshop on Innovative technological solutions for PAin and MEntal health issues</h4>
				<p class="text-justify"> The modern way of living along with the ageing of population brings in the frontline two main categories of
				“diseases”, pain and mental health issues. People can experience pain as a chronic, acute or intermittent
				condition, or a combination of the three. Chronic pain is a complex condition embracing physical,
				psychological and social factors, leading to loss of independence, poor quality of life or even disability. It
				affects around 20% of people worldwide. Distress and functional impairment often accompany chronic
				pain, making it a major source of suffering and economic burden.Very recently, the world Health
				Organization, recognizing the importance of pain, launched the 11th version of the International
				Classification of Disease (ICD-11), where pain was for the first time classified as a disease itself. A main
				characteristic of pain is that it is always subjective. Currently, there is no objective measure of pain. Patient
				reports are the primary source of estimates pain prevalence and severity. Thus, obtaining an objective
				picture of the extent, significance and consequences of pain is still difficult. Moreover, the management of
				pain is another critical issue needing careful consideration. The underlying diseases that cause pain can
				vary, while the treatment approach (pharmaceutical or not) is closely corelated to this. On the other hand,
				negative mental states like depression and anxiety are big problems in modern societies, usually due to
				stressful situations (financial problems, work problems, interpersonal issues and many others). These
				mental health problems can cause many different symptoms. They might affect how someone is feeling
				physically, mentally and also how he/she behaves. Mental health conditions such as depression, anxiety
				and stress represent substantial financial costs for employers and employees, as well as a significant loss for
				society at large. Absenteeism and presenteeism affect the productivity in the workplace and the general
				economy as well. An EU-level estimate of the overall costs, direct health costs and lost productivity is more
				than 450 billion EUR per year.</p>
				
				<p class="text-justify">Nowadays it is widely recognized that Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) may be a
				powerful means for pain or mental health management. However, more knowledge is needed about the
				effectiveness of these interventions or the way they promote good health, and about the barriers to
				effective implementation of such interventions. Numerous research projects have been funded by the
				European Union exploiting the use of smartphones and wearables to support healthcare industry. Latest
				technological developments in artificial intelligence, affective computing, machine learning, and other
				domains, can provide the tools towards a better future for people. Therefore, there is an urgent need to
				create new technologies to monitor the physical and mental health of people during their daily life.</p>

				<h5>Aim</h5>
				<p class="text-justify">Considering the aforementioned remarks, the proposed workshop focuses on the following topics:</p> 
				<ul>
					<li>Interdisciplinary research on innovative technological solutions for people suffering from pain or
					mental health conditions.</li>
					<li>Implementation of recent advances in sensors, IoT in research (data collection and data analysis),
					assessment and intervention for individuals with pain or mental health disorders.</li>
					<li>Further development of Information and Communication Technologies for people suffering from pain
					or mental health disorders.</li>
					<li>Promotion of the desired characteristics for future technological solutions i.e. cost – effectiveness, use
					in open and generalized environments and non-intrusive techniques.</li>
				</ul>	
				<p>Researchers will present their work and receive feedback from their peers. As part of the larger theme of
				the PETRA conference, participants will also have the opportunity to interact with top scientists working
				with pervasive assistive technologies to exchange valuable ideas that could advance the state-of-the-art in
				the field.</p>
