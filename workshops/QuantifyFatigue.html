				<h4><span class="text-info">QuantifyFatigue</span>: 1st International Workshop on Approaches to Monitor and Predict Cognitive and Physical Fatigue</h4>

				<p class="text-justify">Fatigue is a prevalent and persistent aspect of our lives  Fatigue is costly -- costing employers $136 billion a year in loss of productivity -- and fatigue is also a common symptom following brain injury (e.g., Traumatic Brain Injury) or disease (e.g., Multiple Sclerosis or Parkinsonâ€™s Disease).  However, despite over 100 years of research, our understanding of fatigue is still in its infancy.  Efforts to understand fatigue have resulted in three broad divisions:  the type of work that produces fatigue (mental work or physical labor); the type of population that is affected by fatigue (neurotypical individuals or individuals with brain injury / disease); and the type of fatigue that is experienced (whether it is a trait of an individual or a state that an individual experiences).  For example, air traffic controllers are prone to mental fatigue because they must maintain attention for long periods of time, whereas assembly line workers who have to perform repetitive manual labor are prone to physical fatigue.  In both these cases, a period of rest is usually sufficient to alleviate fatigue, provided the worker is neurotypical; however, following brain injury or disease, fatigue is often not alleviated by rest.  Efforts to understand fatigue have been historically limited to self-report questionnaires (assessing state or trait fatigue) that are susceptible to human error and bias.  More recently, researchers have broadened the dependent measures that are used, resulting in more objective indices of fatigue such as brain activation or physiological changes.  These newer metrics hold the potential to more effectively study and monitor fatigue. </p>

				<h5>Topics</h5>
				<p class="text-justify">Topics of interest include, but are not limited to: 
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Objective markers of fatigue</li>
					<li>Extraction and pattern recognition of fatigue-related features in datasets</li>
					<li>Methods and tools for fatigue biosignal data analysis</li>
					<li>Fatigue and health applications.</li>
					<li>The impact of fatigue on learning and performance</li>
					<li>Fatigue in occupational environments</li>
					<li>Fatigue in VR/AR/Robotic applications</li>
					<li>Software and hardware innovations to detect and monitor fatigue.</li>
					<li>Fatigue adaptive systems.</li>
					<li>Fatigue Simulation</li>
					<li>Intervention technologies to alleviate fatigue</li>
					<li>Automatic detection of fatigue events during daily activities</li>
					<li>Health solutions for fatigue management</li>
					
				</ul>

				<h5>Goals </h5>
				<p class="text-justify">This workshop aims to attract academic researchers and industry specialists in fields impacted by fatigue. This workshop will provide a platform to discuss the implementation of technologies to detect, monitor, and account for fatigue in medical and workplace scenarios, as well as in everyday life. Participants will have the opportunity to present and discuss their research with their fellow researchers. Novel and innovative contributions related to the topics of the workshop mentioned above are welcomed.</p>
