                <br>
                <h4>Abstract</h4>
                <p>Advances in Artificial Intelligence and sensing technologies have made it possible to build intelligent solutions aimed
                at improving our daily life, aiming at personalized care items in various areas promoting health and well-being.
                Moreover, big data analysis through cutting- edge AI algorithms is expected to provide new insights into disease
                patterns and contribute to the design of more efficient interventions. Such solutions can promote independent living and
                can become an indispensable part of integrated care technologies. Indeed, spending more time at home but, at the same
                time, making it possible to communicate health-related signals to professionals and caregivers, becomes more necessary
                –and feasible- than ever, especially given the current pandemic and its consequences on maintaining a healthy lifestyle
                with mobility restrictions. Moreover, making sure medical and other information is passed, in a timely and personalized
                manner, to the right healthcare professionals and caregivers is necessary for getting the right consultation and
                well-targeted to the needs of the individual. Such information must reflect personal needs, should take into account
                user habits and preferences and, of course, needs to consider all health-related parameters involved (including disease,
                other comorbidities and medication, amongst others). The role of sensing technologies and artificial intelligence can be
                very crucial in such solutions, as learning form historical data and from users with similar health-related issues and
                needs can be beneficial in building the right AI models.</p>

                <p>However, even if sensing devices (e.g. cameras, wearable devices, movement tracking sensors, etc.) and intelligent
                eHealth applications have improved significantly in the last years, the most promising algorithms for human activity
                analysis, automated behavior recognition and personalization are constrained by the limited existence of available
                datasets, usage context, physical obstacles, individual behavior patterns and preferences. Moreover, underlying health
                conditions vary significantly among individuals for promoting their health and well-being. Another big challenge in data
                analysis and efficient application of artificial intelligence arises from the fact that indoor environments impose
                problems related to sensor noise, scene clutter and false alarms attributed to contextual constraints.</p>

                <p>The 2nd ASSIST workshop invites contributions that seek to advance the state of the art in using AI, eHealth and
                sensor-driven solutions and applications for promoting healthy lifestyles in indoor environments and for the building of
                summarizing results in structured datasets of personalized profiles, in order to facilitate further processing, and
                adding to the body of existing datasets for data-driven research, development and integration in existing integrated
                care solutions.
                </p>

                <br>

                <h4>Goals</h4>
                <p>The scope of this workshop is to bring together researchers, developers and the industry working in the area of data and
                AI-driven solutions in ambient assisted living environments, focusing on the promotion of health benefits and
                personalization. Latest computational models and sensor signal interpretation techniques will be discussed in the form
                of oral presentations of peer-review papers. The workshop will leverage the most recent results from the PROCare4Life
                project, and it will welcome research contributions from the broader research community, following up on the steps of
                the previous ASSIST workshop in 2021.</p>
