                <h3 style="text-align:center"> av-cult: Machine learning solutions for reducing exclusion of persons with hearing loss from cultural content</h3>
                <br>
                <h4>Abstract</h4>
                <p>Hearing loss is a common health problem in today’s societies. For example there are around 50 millions of “hard of
                hearing” people in the EU (around 9% of the total population). One of the biggest challenges of mild or severe hearing
                impaired listeners is being able to understand speech, music and generally sounds that are contained in cultural works
                such as theatrical plays, movies and concerts (Sound can also be needed in other forms of cultural works that do not use audio 
                as their main medium: a visual art exhibition, for example, does not use sound as a main channel but still audio information 
                can be part of the human-human communication or a guidance procedure, etc). This obvious difficulty increases the level 
                of exclusion of people with hearing loss from such activities and therefore significantly influences their quality of life.</p>
                <p>Advances in the technology of hearing aids has only partly improved the ability of the people with mild hearing loss 
                to participate in such cultural events, but it has not helped in severe hearing loss cases. At the same time, modern artificial 
                intelligence applications have made it possible to automatically recognize auditory content and transcribe raw speech to 
                text and present it to the users as enhanced subtitles in Augmented Reality (AR) systems or via haptic interfaces. In 
                addition, deep-learning-based computer vision can help in improving communication of persons with hearing loss, through 
                sign language recognition and facial expression analysis. These advances in automatic sound analysis, AR systems, computer 
                vision, and haptic interfaces can lead to new applications that enable people with even complete hearing loss to follow a 
                theatrical play, fully experience a museum tour or “feel” a live music performance.</p>
                <p>This workshop invites contributions that focus on solutions that adopt: (a) modern audio/music/speech/image/video
                analysis methods and/or (b) innovative human-machine interaction pipelines, in order to boost the ability of the persons
                with hearing loss to follow theatrical plays, concerts, movies, museums, art exhibitions and any cultural content in
                general.</p>

                <br>
                <h4>Goals</h4>
                <p>This workshop aims to attract an interdisciplinary group of researchers from fields such as auditory scene analysis,
                automatic speech recognition and speech analytics, affective computing, music perception, hearing aid technology,
                human-computer interaction and psychology, all focusing in finding solutions for making cultural content that contains
                sound as a basic medium, more easily accessible to people with hearing loss. As part of the larger theme of the PETRA
                conference, the participants will also have the opportunity to interact with top scientists working with pervasive
                assistive technologies to exchange valuable ideas that could advance the state-of-the-art in the field.</p>
