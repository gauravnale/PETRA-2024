				<h4><span class="text-info">IoT-MAT</span>: 2nd International Workshop on Internet-of-Things and Multimodal Assistive Technologies at Home: Interdisciplinary approaches</h4>

				<p class="text-justify"> In times of increasing demands on assistant smart home technologies, it is necessary that these can adapt flexibly, quickly and reliably according to the needs of users. Considering the diversity of people, it is almost impossible to predict which input or output interaction possibility an individual will prefer. Therefore, modern systems should provide a selection of interaction possibilities in advance, so that users can choose from this potpourri of possibilities according to their current life situation. This has the advantage that the system can be adapted to the situation, since e.g. persons with chronically progressive illnesses, such as dementia, have to deal with ad hoc changes of their living conditions. Therefore, especially in research areas like Active and Assisted Living (AAL) and also generally in the development of assistance systems for people with physical and/or mental disabilities, it is a great advantage that concerned people do not have to get used to new systems in a severe stadium of their health condition. The assistance system can be used preventively in younger and/or healthier years as a smart home with focus on comfort tasks, and can take over additional support activities adapted over time.</p>
				<p class="text-justify">Multimodal assistance system solutions mostly consist of not purely technological approaches. Thematic interconnections of technology with other disciplines (e.g. sociology, economics or construction) result primarily from the developed solution bundles consisting of human-driven services and digital technology components. These results, in exciting and profitable human-machine solutions that enable access to technology for people with little affinity for technology, reduce usage barriers and make assistive technology approaches integrable into everyday life.</p>
				<p class="text-justify">In the second edition of the IoT-MAT workshop at the PETRA conference, we would like to focus on these interdisciplinary approaches / project ideas in the field of multimodal assistance systems.</p>
				<p class="text-justify">During the workshop, different projects and their findings were to be presented. Afterwards there would be a discussion round of all participants on the topic of “advantages and disadvantages of developing assistive technology solutions in an interdisciplinary context”.</p>

				<h5>Topics</h5>
				<p class="text-justify">Topics of interest include but are not limited to large scale research projects about: 
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Conceptual methods for multimodal assistance systems</li>
					<li>AAL in Smart Home Technologies</li>
					<li>Multimodal human-system-interaction for people with disabilities</li>
					<li>Assistive technology development in an inter- or transdisciplinary context</li>
					<li>Interdisciplinary evaluations of assistive technologies</li>
				</ul>
				
				<h5>Goals </h5>
				<p class="text-justify"> This workshop, with its participatory character (discussion round), should primarily appeal to researchers who want to face new challenges to broaden their own perspective regarding the described topics of interest. In particular, the workshop addresses researchers from the fields of assistive multimodal technologies, smart homes, Active and Assisted Living and interdisciplinary technology development teams. The researchers are invited to submit papers of their current work and receive feedback from the peers.</p>
