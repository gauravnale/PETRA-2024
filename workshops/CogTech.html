                <h3 style="text-align:center"> CogTech: A workshop on low-cost, non-invasive technologies for decision-making,
                    cognitive wellness, and mental health</h3>
                <br>
                <h4>Abstract</h4>
                <p class="text-justify">A number of low-cost, non-invasive interventions from Western and Indian sciences exist that
                    could enable enhanced decision-making, and help attain cognitive wellness, and mental health
                    among people. First, neuromodulation techniques like transcranial direct current stimulation
                    (tDCS) may allow both healthy and depressed people to improve their decision-making,
                    cognitive wellness, and mental health. Second, neuro- and bio - feedback about
                    electroencephalography (EEG) and heart rate variability (HRV) via low-cost devices may enable
                    people to improve their decision-making, cognitive wellness, and mental health. Third, low-cost
                    social robots provide an opportunity to assess and guide people on the level of their stress,
                    anxiety, and depression. Furthemore, interventions from the Indian Knowledge System (IKS)
                    like meditation, chanting of mantra, and other Indian performing arts (e.g., dance and music)
                    may also allow people to improve their decision-making, and help attain cognitive wellness, and
                    mental health. However, currently the research in this area has been scanty.</p>

                <p class="text-justify">The likely benefits from the Western and Indian science low-cost, non-invasive interventions as
                    mentioned above are as follows:
                    <ol>
                        <li>People can self-administer these interventions in their homes.</li>
                        <li>These interventions can address mental health problems and cognitive wellness
                    requirements of both affected and healthy populations in an easy-to-use manner.</li>
                        <li>These interventions would reduce cost compared to existing methods that may require
                    repeated trips to doctors and hospitals.</li>
                        </ol>
                    This workshop invites contributions in the above areas to foster the nurture of knowledge and
                    understanding with the progressive acceptance of the methods to bring in accessibility of medical
                    care at a low cost and with the use of non-invasive processes aided by HCI-based technology.</p>
            
                <br>    
                
                <h4>Goals</h4>
                <p class="text-justify">This workshop aims to attract an interdisciplinary group of researchers, practitioners, and
                    academicians from the fields of Computer Science, Industrial Design and Cognitive and
                    Medical Sciences. The research topics would be related to western and Indian science
                    low-cost, non-invasive interventions focusing on novel technologies that aim to improve
                    decision-making, cognitive wellness, and mental health. The researchers, practitioners, and
                    academicians are expected to present their research work in the above areas, and would
                    receive feedback from their peers. As part of the larger theme of the PETRA conference, the
                    participants would also have the opportunity to interact with the leading scientists engaged
                    with other Western and Indian science low-cost, non-invasive, assistive based interventions
                    leading to a vibrant exchange of valuable ideas that could advance the state-of-the-art
                    transformative technologies relevant to the field of medical treatment and mental health.</p>
