                <br>
                <h4>Abstract</h4>
                <!--
                <p>After successfully organizing four workshops on “Designing Assistive Environments for Manufacturing” (DAEM) at PETRA
                2017–2020, which all created valuable academic discussions, we want to consolidate the exchange and foster the community
                in this domain. Therefore, we propose a fifth DAEM workshop to be held at PETRA 2022. First experiences of new
                technologies, such as Augmented Reality or in-situ projection in the manufacturing domain, have been presented at our
                first workshop in 2017 and the evaluations show the potential that new technologies bring into the domain. Our following
                workshops in 2018, 2019, and 2020 focused on questions about how these systems affect work in the short and long run.
                Further, the papers showed the implications of assistive technologies in manufacturing environments. Still, lots of
                questions are open and new questions arose in the meantime. In our fifth workshop, DAEM 5, we intend to focus on how to
                improve job satisfaction with new trends in assistive technologies. This includes topics such as enhancing occupational
                health management as well as integrating voice-user interfaces or meaningful applications of artificial intelligence
                into the manufacturing workplace.</p>

                <p>By proposing this workshop, we are eager to continue the discussion with researchers and professionals from the HCI
                community. We will take account of the current state of the art in order to provide an incentive for collaboration and
                to formulate research questions related to the design of assistive environments for manufacturing.</p>

                <p>Following the successful organization of four (4) previous workshops on “Designing Assistive Environments for
                Manufacturing” (DAEM) at PETRA 2017–2020, which created valuable academic discussions, we wish to consolidate the
                exchange and foster the community in this domain. Therefore, we propose a fifth DAEM workshop to be held at PETRA 2022.

                short and long run. Further, the papers showed the implications of assistive technologies in manufacturing environments.

                <br>
                <h4>Goals</h4>
                <p>The fundamental change that is happening in manufacturing transforms the practice of running independent manufacturing units to the implementation of novel and networked cyber-physical systems. The
                digitalization of industrial production, often referred to as “Industrie 4.0” (GER), “Industrial Internet of Things”
                (US), or “Industrie du Futur” (FRA), lays the groundwork for more flexible and efficient ways of producing goods. This
                new approach is often highly complex, putting strains on the operators and supervisors of such systems. Hence, new
                research questions related to the assistance of humans in the industrial context arise. In the last four years, we
                organized workshops on “Designing Assistive Environments for Manufacturing” (DAEM) at PETRA 2017, PETRA 2018, PETRA
                2019, and PETRA 2020. The first half-day workshop in 2017 with five accepted papers created a first valuable academic
                exchange and established a cross-organizational community. With twelve accepted papers, the workshop was extended to a
                full-day workshop in 2018. The second workshop fostered the community that is in regular contact and actively driving
                the research topic in the form of joint research work, publications, and projects. In 2019, the workshop accepted eleven
                papers and contributed an additional invited talk held by Prof. Oliver Korn. In 2020, we accepted three papers that
                consolidated how artificial intelligence and developments in augmented reality lead to an improvement in assembly
                performance. Due to the pandemic, we had to skip the workshop in 2021. Building on these successful workshops in the
                years 2017–2020, we seek again to assemble researchers and practitioners from HCI in order to continue pushing the
                research agenda related to the design of assistive environments for manufacturing and to discuss the latest research
                results. The workshop will intensify existing collaborations, help to establish new ones, and provide a platform for
                exchanging ideas relevant to the domain. Of course, we welcome both recurring and new participants for this workshop.
                </p>

                <h4>Organizational Details</h4>
                <p>For PETRA 2022, we envision a full-day workshop. The workshop will be organized in the following way: First, we will
                begin with a short opening presentation with background on our workshop, followed by a short kick-off activity, where
                participants get to know each other. Second, we will take account of the state of the art by having workshop
                participants present their submitted papers to the group and a succeeding discussion for each of the presentations. All
                papers will be classified according to their topic and presented within about three sessions. Finally, we will conclude
                the workshop with a wrap-up session in the later afternoon. All participants will be encouraged to have a joint dinner
                in the evening to continue vivid discussions in a more informal setting. We plan to publish the workshop papers along
                with the PETRA 2022 proceedings in order to make them accessible to everyone interested in the design of assistive
                environments for manufacturing.</p>
