				<h4><span class="text-info">DAEM 5</span>: 5th International Workshop on Designing Assistive Environments for Manufacturing</h4>

				<p class="text-justify"> After successfully organizing four workshops on “Designing Assistive Environments for
				Manufacturing” (DAEM) at PETRA 2017–2020, which all created valuable academic
				discussions, we want to consolidate the exchange and foster the community in this domain.
				Therefore, we propose a fifth DAEM workshop to be held at PETRA 2021. First experiences
				of new technologies, such as Augmented Reality or in-situ projection in the manufacturing
				domain, have been presented at our first workshop in 2017 and the evaluations show the
				potential that new technologies bring into the domain. Our following workshops in 2018,
				2019, and 2020 focused on questions about how these systems affect work in the short and
				long run. Further, the papers showed the implications of assistive technologies in
				manufacturing environments. Still, lots of questions are open and new questions arose in the
				meantime. In our fifth workshop, DAEM 5, we intend to focus on how to improve job
				satisfaction with new trends in assistive technologies. This includes topics such as enhancing
				occupational health management as well as integrating voice-user interfaces or meaningful
				applications of artificial intelligence into the manufacturing workplace.</p>

				<p class="text-justify"> By proposing this workshop, we are eager to continue the discussion with researchers and
				professionals from the HCI community. We will take account of the current state of the art in
				order to provide an incentive for collaboration and to formulate research questions related to
				the design of assistive environments for manufacturing.</p>

				<h5>Organizational Details and List of Topics</h5>
				<p class="text-justify">For PETRA 2021, we envision a full-day workshop. The workshop will be organized in the
				following way: First, we will begin with a short opening presentation with background on
				our workshop, followed by a short kick-off activity, where participants get to know each
				other. Second, we will take account of the state of the art by having workshop participants
				present their submitted papers to the group and a succeeding discussion for each of the
				presentations. All papers will be classified according to their topic and presented within
				about three sessions. Finally, we will conclude the workshop with a wrap-up session in the
				later afternoon. All participants will be encouraged to have a joint dinner in the evening to
				continue vivid discussions in a more informal setting. We plan to publish the workshop
				papers along with the PETRA 2021 proceedings in order to make them accessible to
				everyone interested in the design of assistive environments for manufacturing. Topics of
				submissions are encouraged but not limited to covering the following areas of assistive
				environments for manufacturing:</p>

				<h5>Goals </h5>
				<p class="text-justify">The fundamental change that is happening in manufacturing transforms the practice of
				running independent manufacturing units to the implementation of novel and networked
				cyber-physical systems. The digitalization of industrial production, often referred to as
				“Industrie 4.0” (GER), “Industrial Internet of Things” (US), or “Industrie du Futur” (FRA),
				lays the groundwork for more flexible and efficient ways of producing goods. This new
				approach is often highly complex, putting strains on the operators and supervisors of such
				systems. Hence, new research questions related to the assistance of humans in the industrial
				context arise. In the last four years, we organized workshops on “Designing Assistive
				Environments for Manufacturing” (DAEM) at PETRA 2017, PETRA 2018, PETRA 2019,
				and PETRA 2020. The first half-day workshop in 2017 with five accepted papers created a
				first valuable academic exchange and established a cross-organizational community. With
				twelve accepted papers, the workshop was extended to a full-day workshop in 2018. The
				second workshop fostered the community that is in regular contact and actively driving the
				research topic in the form of joint research work, publications, and projects. In 2019, the
				workshop accepted eleven papers and contributed an additional invited talk held by Prof.
				Oliver Korn. In 2020, we accepted three papers that consolidated how artificial intelligence
				and developments in augmented reality lead to an improvement in assembly performance.
				Building on this success, we seek again to assemble researchers and practitioners from HCI
				in order to continue pushing the research agenda related to the design of assistive
				environments for manufacturing and to discuss the latest research results. The workshop will
				intensify existing collaborations, help to establish new ones, and provide a platform for
				exchanging ideas relevant to the domain. Of course, we welcome both recurring and new
				participants for this workshop.</p>
