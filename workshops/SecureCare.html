				<h4><span class="text-info">SecureCare</span>: 1st International Workshop on Cybersecurity in Healthcare: From device design to Healthcare in Practise</h4>

				<p class="text-justify"> Following the WannaCry attack in May 2017 which affected healthcare organisations around the world, there has been a particular emphasis on patient data and cybersecurity. More recently we have seen how medical images and diagnostics can be interfered with leading to the wrong diagnosis.
				</p>

				<p class="text-justify"> Disruption to the functionality of medical devices or ransomware that shuts down the entire infrastructure may ultimately lead to loss of lives. Insecure storage and access to data can lead to information leakage which can result in large fines to healthcare organisations under various Privacy laws.  Guidance for developing secure medical devices is relatively new, GDPR is making its mark, new technology is constantly being introduced and the context of use is extending from hospital base into the patients homes. On top of this, staff are fatigued and pressurised which can lead to workarounds and errors. This has left healthcare vulnerable.
				</p>

				<p class="text-justify"> The points mentioned above emphasize the need for more understanding of how to effectively secure healthcare delivery and medical device design.  This understanding must incorporate a holistic approach addressing both the technical and the human aspects as well as the organisational context.
				</p>

				<p class="text-justify"> This workshop invites contributions that seek to advance the current understanding of cybersecurity in relation to medical devices and healthcare information systems. This includes  exploring the current threat landscape and to identify potential solutions. We are interested in understanding and addressing the problem from a people, organisational and  technology perspective. 
				</p>

				<h5>Topics</h5>
				<p class="text-justify">Topics of interest include but are not limited to: 
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Understanding the cybersecurity and privacy behaviours of patients and healthcare workers</li>
					<li>How can we get the carers to care about cybersecurity</li>
					<li>How can we affect behaviour and culture change to improve cybersecurity in healthcare</li>
					<li>Shifting the healthcare leadership culture to be cybersecure</li>
					<li>Increasing resistance to cyberthreats</li>
					<li>Privacy and security considerations of smart healthcare devices</li>
					<li>Challenges facing health organisations in identifying cyber risk </li>
					<li>Current and emerging threats to healthcare information privacy and security, infrastructure and medical devices</li>
					<li>How should cybersecurity be designed into medical devices</li>
					<li>Workarounds and patient safety – the ethics</li>
					<li>Detecting breaches – how do you know</li>
					<li>The role of standards and guidance in improving cybersecurity in Healthcare</li>
				</ul>

				<h5>Goals </h5>
				<p class="text-justify"> This workshop aims to attract an interdisciplinary group of researchers who are involved in research and practise related to cybersecurity and privacy in healthcare. The researchers will have the opportunity to present their work with peers and explore the problems from different perspectives. </p>
