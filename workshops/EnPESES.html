                <h3 style="text-align:center"> Citizens and the Future of Energy: A workshop on Engagement, Participation and Empowerment in Smart Energy Systems
                (EnPE-SES)</h3>
                <br>
                <h4>Abstract</h4>
                <p>Major environmental pressures and emerging innovations are transforming the energy sector in ways that put the consumer
                at the heart of developments. The decentralisation of generation, e.g., via use of photovoltaic panels and wind
                turbines, as well as utilisation of local storage based on lithium-ion batteries or even electric vehicles, reshape not
                only the traditional generation and distribution infrastructure but also the relevant operational and business models of
                the entire sector. The greater accessibility to distributed and off-grid assets that are targeted to commercial estates
                and increasingly to households, enable organisations and individual citizens to assume a more involved role in a future
                energy system. That role may include trading of surplus energy back to a national grid (hence the term ‘prosumer’, as a
                consumer may be able to produce energy), membership to a local, physical (or even virtual) community of associated
                individual households etc.</p>
                <p>Technology developments include smarter management of local energy assets, grid flexibility for managing fluctuations in
                supply and demand, advanced modelling based on real-time data, digital twinning of assets with high fidelity models,
                algorithmic trading of surplus energy and the use of distributed ledger technology to assure transaction data integrity
                and authenticity. Their potential for transformational impact is high, but there are also concerns about unintended
                consequences such as increased privacy risks, digital exclusion, exacerbation of energy poverty for communities deprived
                of digital skills or access to infrastructure etc.</p>
                <p>Therefore, in a landscape so dynamic and evolving, citizen engagement and participation is deemed crucial for the
                success of the related technologies and their operation. As such, a number of challenges arise that range from the
                necessary access to infrastructure and investment, to enabling policies and the skills required from the individual
                citizen. Questions are also posed around who may be excluded from a distributed generation and highly decentralised
                system, what would fuel poverty look like and whether it could be eradicated, whether citizens are ready to become
                active agents of a transactive energy marketplace etc.</p>
                <p>EnPE-SES will seek to examine these questions and explore energy futures through the lenses of socio-technical analyses,
                and the means to enable greater engagement, participation and ultimately empowerment of citizens through this journey.
                We solicit contributions across a number of disciplines including policy studies, HCI, data privacy, energy informatics,
                systems engineering, technology management, business process modelling etc.</p>

                <br>
                <h4>Goals</h4>
                <p>The workshop will be organised under the auspices of the Horizon 2020 funded project TwinERGY (‘Intelligent
                interconnection of prosumers in positive energy communities with twins of things for digital energy markets’, Grant
                agreement ID: 957736). It aims to bring together a multidisciplinary base or researchers from engineering and computer
                science, management and marketing, policy studies, social and behavioural sciences and mathematical modelling to debate
                and explore the future of energy systems from a citizen-driven viewpoint. Having the ability to interact with the wider
                PETRA delegate base that includes top experts of pervasive technologies, assisted living, HCI, human factors etc. will
                allow for greater contextualisation of domestic energy innovations and appreciation for the link between the technology
                and the individual.</p>
