                <h4>Abstract</h4>
                <!--
                <p>Nowadays the healthcare is one of the most important research field topic. With the overcoming of new technology trends
                a large number of good clinical results have been achieved. The combining of most recent machine learning methods with
                healthcare and human-life sciences performs appreciable results. Human-life data (i.e. genomics, RMI) stored into
                specific files require very large sizes. Despite the newest existing architectures, the management, analysis and its
                computations turn out very difficult. In order to obtain a gain of performances in accuracy, efficiency and reliability
                terms the numerical anal- ysis combined with intelligent artificial are able to provide a very helpful results.</p>

                <p>During the recent global urgency desaeas, scientists, clinicians, and healthcare experts around the world keep on
                searching for a new technology to support in tackling the COVID-19 pandemic. The great use of Machine Learning (ML) and
                Artificial Intelligence (AI) application on the epidemic are very helpful for researchers by giving a new angle to fight
                against the novel Coronavirus out- break. Several research papers propose new methods which are able to perform a
                prediction or treatment for the novel COVID-19 desease. ML combined with efficient numerical schema give us new
                frontiers in war against the recent pan- demic with respect to canonical approaches.</p>

                <p>This workshop invites novel contributions that build a great scientific impact in order to advance the current standards
                in computational healthcare sciences.</p>
                -->
                <p>Recently, healthcare has been considered as one of the most important research application topics. To this end, and with the
                emergence of new technological trends, a large number of promising clinical results have been achieved. The combination
                of recent Machine Learning methods with healthcare and human-life science applications have delivered appreciable
                results. Human-life data (i.e., genomics, RMI) stored into specific files require very large sizes. Despite the newest
                existing architectures, the management, analysis and computational processing of this data turns out to be very
                difficult. In order to gain an advantage of performance in terms of accuracy, efficiency and reliability, numerical
                analysis combined with artificial intelligence methods can achieve significant outcomes.</p>

                <p>During the recent COVID-19 pandemic, scientists, clinicians, and healthcare experts around the world keep on searching
                for a new technology to tackle this pandemic. Applying Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods
                can be very helpful in providing a new approach to fight against the novel Coronavirus outbreak. Several research papers
                propose new methods which are able to perform a prediction or treatment for the novel COVID-19 disease. ML, combined
                with efficient numerical schemas, give us new frontiers in the war against this pandemic, in comparison to the use of
                canonical approaches.</p>

                <p>This workshop invites novel contributions that have a strong scientific impact in advancing the current standards,
                methods and tools in computational healthcare sciences and on advanced numerical computations for big human data
                analysis.</p>


                <br>
                <h4>Goals</h4>
                <p>The goal of this workshop is to provide a forum for discussing and analyzing recent trends in data mining and analysis,
                mainly focused on computer science and numerical aspects. Moreover, the aforementioned fields are widely exploitable for
                several human life problems (e.g. genoma analysis, healthcare prediction, cancer risk management). The application of
                advanced numerical techniques with Machine learning methods performs very appreciable results in the health- care
                sciences. The aim is to bridge theoretical issues and numerical aspects to debate on mathematical and computational
                foundations of algorithmic approaches able to infer knowledge from data. Speeches and Communications on Clustering,
                Genomics and Proteomics analysis, Supervised and Unsupervised Classification schemes, Data Mining methods, Numerical
                schema, Efficient and Reliable algorithmic strategies for data analysis and mining are welcome.</p>
