				<h3>Special opportunity to attend two back to back conferences June 25-July 2nd 2021 in Greece </h3>
				<p class="text-justify">
					We would like to bring to your attention a special opportunity to attend two back to back computer
					science
					conferences taking place in two beautiful islands in Greece in June 2021.
				<ul>
					<li>The 17th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence Applications and Innovations
						(<a href="http://www.aiai2021.eu"> AIAI </a>) on the island of CRETE (June 25-27, 2021) and
					<li>The 14th International Conference on The PErvasive Technologies Related to Assistive
						Environments
						(<a href="../index.html">PETRA </a>) on the island of CORFU (June 29-July 2nd). </li>
				</ul>
				Thus, one could attend both conferences in a period of one week, by flying first to Crete for AIAI
				and then flying from Crete to Corfu for PETRA, perhaps with a short stopover in Athens!
				</p>
				-->
					<!--
					<p>
						Furthermore, we urge you to proceed with the registration which is the same for virtual and
						physical presence because the cost of running the conference in hybrid mode is high due to
						arranging for both physical and virtual conference access. A final decision will be made on
						April 27.
